# Esparta's dot files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. It's based
on @rook config files.

## Installation

  `git clone git://github.com/esparta/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  `cd ~/.dotfiles
  `rake install`

Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle
to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
  Run :BundleInstall in vim.
